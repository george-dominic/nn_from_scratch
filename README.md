# Neural network from scratch
This repo attempts to build a neural network library from scratch following [Karpathy's excercise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMj-3S1tku0&list=PLAqhIrjkxbuWI23v9cThsA9GvCAUhRvKZ) in building [micrograd](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd) which is a Pytorch inspired micro library of neural networks
